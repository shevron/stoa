Stoa - A Simple Blogging Platform
==============================================================================
Stoa aims to be a simple, minimalistic blogging platform with focus on ease of
use and general happiness. 

Currently, Stoa is still under heavy development. It is probably broken in 
many ways and simply incomplete in others. Do not use it in production.

Some Technical Stuff
